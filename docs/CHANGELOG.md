# Changelog

All important changes of this project must be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project orients towards [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Note: This project needs KSP to work and every new Ktorfit with an update of the KSP version is technically a breaking change.
But there is no intent to bump the Ktorfit major version for every KSP update. 

2.0.1 - 2024-08-08
========================================
### Fixed
- #594 Endpoint with types from other module
- #591 Ktorfit plugin doesn't include correct generate source if build directory changes #591
- #621 RequestConverter causing compile error
- Build with Ktor 2.3.12

ktorfit-ksp-2.0.0-1.0.24 - 2024-08-06
========================================
- Build with KSP 1.0.24

ktorfit-ksp-2.0.0-1.0.23 - 2024-07-14
========================================
- Build with KSP 1.0.23
- 
ktorfit-ksp-2.0.0-1.0.22 - 2024-06-06
========================================
- Build with KSP 1.0.22

2.0.0 - 2024-05-27
========================================
### Changed
- Build with KSP 1.0.21, Kotlin 2.0.0, Ktor 2.3.11
- The needed dependencies for Ktorfit KSP processor are now included in the Ktorfit Gradle plugin. You can remove the ksp() block from your build.gradle.kts file. You still need to apply the KSP plugin. 
  
```kotlin
plugins {
id("com.google.devtools.ksp") version "CURRENT_KSP_VERSION"
id("de.jensklingenberg.ktorfit") version "2.0.0"
}
```

See the installation guide for more information: https://foso.github.io/Ktorfit/installation/

- The code that is generated by KSP is now accessible from the module where the interface is defined. That means code from commonMain can now find the generated code. Generated code from the platform specific code is still only available from the specific modules.
- The **create** function is now deprecated. The reason for that is that it is relying on a compiler plugin to work. This can lead to compile errors when the class can't be found. The plan is to get rid of the plugin. When your project is configured correct, the autocompletion should show an extension function *create* followed by the name of the interface. This function will not trigger the compiler plugin

```kotlin
val api = ktorfit.create<ExampleApi>()
```

replace with:

```kotlin
val api = ktorfit.createExampleApi()
```

### Breaking Changes

The deprecated code got removed.
This will simplify the codebase and make it easier to maintain.
When you haven't used the deprecated converters, there is not much you need to change.
The dependencies for the converters that were previously auto added now need to be added manually.
See the migration guide for more information: https://foso.github.io/Ktorfit/migration/#from-2-to-200

* QualifiedTypeName in Ktorfit

In the previous versions of Ktorfit, the `qualifiedTypename` was always generated in the code. This was used in the `TypeData.createTypeData()` function to provide a fully qualified type name for the data type being used.

```kotlin
val _typeData = TypeData.createTypeData(
    typeInfo = typeInfo<Call<People>>(),
    qualifiedTypename = "de.jensklingenberg.ktorfit.Call<com.example.model.People>"
)
```

In the new version of Ktorfit, this behavior has been changed. Now, by default, Ktorfit will keep `qualifiedTypename` for `TypeData` in the generated code empty. This means that the `qualifiedTypename` will not be automatically generated.

```kotlin
val _typeData = TypeData.createTypeData(
    typeInfo = typeInfo<Call<People>>(),
)
```

However, if you want to keep the old behavior and generate `qualifiedTypename`, you can set it in the Ktorfit config `generateQualifiedTypeName` to `true` in your `build.gradle.kts` file.

```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
ktorfit {
  generateQualifiedTypeName = true
}
```

This change was made to provide more flexibility and control to the developers over the generated code. Please update your code accordingly if you were relying on the automatic generation of `qualifiedTypename`.

### Fixed
- Fixes https://github.com/Foso/Ktorfit/issues/548

2.0.0-rc01 - 2024-05-19
========================================
- Build with KSP 1.0.20, Kotlin 2.0.0-RC3, Ktor 2.3.11
- Optimize code generation
- Fixes https://github.com/Foso/Ktorfit/issues/548

2.0.0-beta1 - 2024-04-28

```

However, if you want to keep the old behavior and generate `qualifiedTypename`, you can set a KSP argument `Ktorfit_QualifiedTypeName` to `true` in your `build.gradle.kts` file.

```kotlin
ksp {
    arg("Ktorfit_QualifiedTypeName", "true")
}
```

This change was made to provide more flexibility and control to the developers over the generated code. Please update your code accordingly if you were relying on the automatic generation of `qualifiedTypename`.

1.0.0-beta15 (05-10-2022)
========================================
⬆️ Deps updates

- based on Ktor 2.1.2

🐛 Bugs fixed

- kotlinx.coroutines.JobCancellationException: Parent job is Completed #70

💥 Breaking changes

- reverted the api of converters to the state of beta13, see #71 
- when you are updating from beta13, this is the only change to converters:
  returnTypeName is replaced through typeData, you can use typeData.qualifiedName to get the same value as returnTypeName


1.0.0-beta14 (24-09-2022)
========================================
NEW:
- Query parameters can now be nullable, null values will be ignored in requests
- Function return types can now be nullable

FIX:
- Url annotation not resolved correctly #65

BREAKING CHANGES:
- Changed naming of Converters:

  - SuspendResponseConverter:
    - is now called RequestConverter
    - the wrapSuspendResponse is now called convertRequest.
    - returnTypeName is replaced through typeData, you can use typeData.qualifiedName to get the same value as returnTypeName
      RequestConverter need to be added with the requestConverter() on your Ktorfit object.
    - [https://foso.github.io/Ktorfit/requestconverter/](https://foso.github.io/Ktorfit/requestconverter/)
  - ResponseConverters:
    - returnTypeName is replaced through typeData, you can use typeData.qualifiedName to get the same value as returnTypeName
      [https://foso.github.io/Ktorfit/responseconverter/](https://foso.github.io/Ktorfit/responseconverter/)


1.0.0-beta13 (10-09-2022)
========================================
- KtorfitCallResponseConverter and KtorfitSuspendCallResponseConverter are now combined in KtorfitCallResponseConverter
- based on Ktor 2.1.1

Fixed:
- Url annotation not resolved correctly #52

1.0.0-beta12 (31-08-2022)
========================================
## Breaking Changes: 
wrapResponse from SuspendResponseConverter got renamed to wrapSuspendResponse. This add the possibility to have ResponseConverter and SuspendResponseConverter implemented in the same class.

## Changes: 
- throw compiler time error when you use @Path without the corresponding value inside the relative url path
- every generated implementation class of an interface that Ktorfit generates will now contain a "create" ext function that can be used instead of the generic create() function
e.g. Let's say you have a interface GithubService, then you can create an instance like this:

```kotlin
val ktorfit = ktorfit {
baseUrl("http://example.com/")
}.create<GithubService>()
```
or this

```kotlin
val ktorfit = ktorfit {
baseUrl("http://example.com/")
}.createGithubService()
```

By default, IntelliJ/Android Studio can't find the generated code, you need to add the KSP generated folder to the sourcesets 
like this: (See more here: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/ksp-quickstart.html#make-ide-aware-of-generated-code)

```kotlin
kotlin.srcDir("build/generated/ksp/jvm/jvmMain/")
```


1.0.0-beta11 (21-08-2022)
========================================

- you can now use ResponseConverter in combination with suspend functions. Implement the SuspendResponseConverter
- KtorfitCallResponseConverter and FlowResponseConverter moved to de.jensklingenberg.ktorfit.converter.builtin


1.0.0-beta10 (18-08-2022)
========================================

- based on Ktor 2.0.2
- added windows target #26
- @PATCH, @POST, @PUT now have a default value #22
- Ktorfit now uses a builder pattern for setup
 e.g. change this: 
 ```kotlin
 Ktorfit("https://example.com/", HttpClient {})
```
 

to this: 

```kotlin
Ktorfit.Builder()
.baseUrl("https://example.com/")
.httpClient(HttpClient {})
.build()
```

- 
## Breaking Changes:
@Headers now requires a vararg of String instead of an Array
e.g. you need to change from:

```kotlin
@Headers(
["Authorization: token ghp_abcdefgh",
"Content-Type: application/json"]
)
```


to this:
```kotlin
@Headers(
"Authorization: token ghp_abcdefgh",
"Content-Type: application/json"
)
```
